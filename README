How to execute Code?
1)Load the script from the project folder
source("F:\\Fall 2014\\GDM\\P4\\findAnamoly.R")

2)call the function to detect anomaly.
findAnamoly(fileInputPath=<input_folder>,fileOutPutPath=<>output_folder>,featureToUse=<feature_to_be_used>,windowSizeLength=<window_size>)

Note:1) featureToUse can be 'degree' or 'clustCoeff' or 'egoNet' 
	 2) Make sure output folder exists
example:
feature = 'degree'
feature = 'clustCoeff' 
feature = 'egoNet' 
findAnamoly(fileInputPath="F:\\Fall 2014\\GDM\\P4\\data\\enron",
            fileOutPutPath="F:\\Fall 2014\\GDM\\P4\\output",
            featureToUse="egoNet",
            windowSizeLength=7)

==================================================================================================
INPUT:
Input is assumed to be edgelist of files for each day with name as <day>_<name>.txt
The first line consists of number of global vertices and number of local edges seperated by space
The following lines consists of edges in the form of <from> <to>
==================================================================================================
OUTPUT:
The function findAnamoly stores the output files to the output folder. Filename format for output file output_<feature>_timestamp.txt
Example:output_clustCoeff_1415163567

The first line indicates the total number of anomalies that the algorithm detected.The following lines are a list of anomalous time points.
Anomalous time points indicate the starting day for the week that consists of anomalous points. The anomalous points lie within the
[Staring day, Staring day+6] range of days. All of the anomalous time points are listed if there are fewer than 10, the top 10 if there are fewer than 100, 
or the top 10% if there are more than 100. 

The function also plots the graph showing all the points and a threshold line. All the points above threshold are anomalous points.
==================================================================================================

TESTING:
Code is run on enron,enron_noempty and reality_mining_voices data set.
